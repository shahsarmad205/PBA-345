## Project Description
BudgetMate is a personal budgeting and expense tracking web application designed to help users manage their finances efficiently. The app allows users to record their income and expenses, categorize spending, and monitor their financial health over time.

The primary goal of BudgetMate is to provide a simple, user-friendly platform where users can:
- Add income and expense entries
- Categorize transactions (e.g., Food, Rent, Transportation, Shopping)
- View summaries and balance calculations
- Visualize spending habits through charts or graphs 

BudgetMate helps users stay on top of their budget, track their spending patterns, and plan for their financial goals. Future updates may include features like setting savings goals, exporting reports, and integrating with bank APIs for real-time data.
